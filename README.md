# dmlua
A small lua debugging tool

I commissioned to steamport#2763 to write this.

## build instructions
unzip tcc, its a self extracting archive

run compile.bat

## how to use this
copy dmlua.dm & dmlua.dll into your project

create a lua folder, in that folder create global.lua this will run before any lua file call.
